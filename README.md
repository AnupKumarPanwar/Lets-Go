# Let-s-Go
An Open Source Book for learning Go Language…

Today is the era of Computer Science and more and more students are choosing software engineering as their career. The reason is probably handsome packages, wide range of opportunities and yes most important the name and fame.
Now when I talk about the name and fame, Google and Facebook that run the internet are the dream companies of all. Being a BE CSE student similar is my case. But before going through the interview process of such big firms an engineer must know what technologies they use and have a good hand over it. As the name suggests Go is Google’s Language. So this Open Source Book called “Let’s Go” will guide the beginners through the general purpose programming in Go Language.
